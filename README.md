## 🌟 About Me

28 • Autistic T-Girl • Dog/Rat thing • Based in Berlin, Germany

I'm a full-stack developer and environmental artist who spends most of my time orchestrating large-scale virtual reality events and building tools for the VRChat community. When I'm not wrangling servers or writing shaders, I'm probably coordinating massive rave events in VR.

### 🎭 Current Roles

- 🏢 **CEO** @ [VirtuaLabs](https://virtualabs.cloud) — Shaders, Tools & Immersive Environments
- 🎪 **Head of Operations** @ [Gathering](https://tgvr.org) & Paradise Lost
- 🔧 **Admin Staff** @ RIFT_VR
- 💼 **Secretary of Technology** @ Ministry Promotions
- 🎮 **Developer** @ GEARFEST, VIRTUAFEST, and other major VR events

### ⚡ What I Do

- **Event Infrastructure**: Building scalable systems for massive VR gatherings (Gathering, VirtuaFest, GearFest & more)
- **VRChat Development**: Creating worlds, tools, and experiences with UdonSharp, Unity, and custom shaders
- **Full-Stack Development**: Currently diving deep into Fastify for high-performance web services
- **Environmental Art**: Crafting immersive virtual spaces that bring communities together
- **Operations Management**: Keeping the chaos organized when thousands of people show up to a VR rave

## 💬 Let's Connect

I'm usually "on call" 24/7 working on events and infrastructure. Not great at the "chat" part of VRChat since I'm usually elbow-deep in systems management, but feel free to reach out!

**Fair warning**: I'm dense as a brick when it comes to flirting, and I might drop everything without warning if production goes sideways.

## 🎨 Philosophy

> "Sometimes people should stop asking themselves if they could, and instead start asking themselves if they should."

Building tools and experiences that bring people together in virtual spaces. Currently focused on making large-scale VR events run smoothly and creating developer tools that don't make you want to throw your headset out the window.

  **⚠️ Important Notes**
  
  • Not interested in poly/open relationships  
  • Please ask before touching (consent matters even in VR!)  
  • I might vanish mid-conversation if servers catch fire
